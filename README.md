Mobile Software Weather/Calendar/Progress_Tracker/To-Do App

The Calendar / Existing List Task Page will display a Custom Calendar displaying the current date, month, year along with the current existing tasks.

The page will be halved with the two things - Calendar and Existing Tasks.

The Custom Calendar has a set of list dates, year and the current month will be highlighted in turquoise while days that aren't are in white.
I have attempted to include returning dates, however I did not have the time to include it.

The Existing List will display the current lists available and you are able to tick it or untick if it has been done.
This is displayed with the help of a Recycler View. I have also implemented a swipe functionality so when a task is swiped left, it allows the user
to delete that task.
